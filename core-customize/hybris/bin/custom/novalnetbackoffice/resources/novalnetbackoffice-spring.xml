    The hybris platform provides one single Spring application context for beans located at the jalo layer.
    Each extension can add beans to this context by specifying them at this configuration file.

    You can use and/or redefine beans defined at configuration files of other extensions as well as
    adding new one.

    If you want to locate this file at a different location or want to use several files for better,
    structuring, please use the '<yourextension>.application-context' property at your project.properties file.
    There you can specify a comma separated list of files where first is tried to find a file per classpath and
    then per file system.


    If you want to configure beans for your web module please have a look at
    your web/webroot/WEB-INF/<extname>-web-spring.xml.
    -->
